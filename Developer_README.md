# DEVELOPER's NOTES

This repository has been created just to deposit the main idea, but unfortunately I'm out of time / resources to work on it on my own.
That's why a collaboration will be really appreciated by everyone who can give any little help. 

The idea is to keep this repo linked the mobile app, then create another one for the backend code, that will handle communications between the apps, 
Google APIs, and persist the required information to a DB.

Fell free to start the project by using the technologies you consider appropriate for the scope.

For direct messaging send me a Whatsapp message on +39 347 552 08 36 . 

Thank you,
Federico Ricchiuto
